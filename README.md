### Communication: most of my findings are communicated here   

Enviroment: Using jupyter notebooks,python 3

**Libraries used**:
1- Pandas
2- Scikit learn
3- Matplotlib , sea born
4- Sklearn
5- Pandas



### Dataset used: Placement_Data_Full_Class  from kaggle




### The Questions which analysis is answering.

1.Who is getting more placements girls or boys and what are the ranges?

2.Which board students are gettting more placed and who got higher package

3.Which Stream students after the 12 have changed their stream mostly 

4.Does Percentage in College determine salary

5.Does Work Experience affect placements?


## Conclusion:


Male are mostly placed then female and mean salary of male is more than female.After 12 many of science students changed their stream,percentage in college is not a big factor for getting placed.
